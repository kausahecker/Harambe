        <p id="intro">Hi mom! It's Snoopy :). Dad knows that you are mad at him right now, and that you probably hate him. So, he asked me to come here and help you bitch about him or just be there for you anyway :). Don't worry, I'll be awake all day and night (I get that from dad) so whether it is 3am in the morning or 2pm after college ends, I'll always be here with you :). </p>
